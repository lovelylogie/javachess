when the program starts it will ask if you want a 'FEN' (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) 
for example this is the FEN for the starting position

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

you can use websites such as https://lichess.org/editor to create a layout and 
then copy the FEN from the bottom of the website

pressing 'r' will rotate the board

all concepts of chess have been implemented in this program except for inadequate 
material draw, 3 fold repition draw and 50 move rule draw
